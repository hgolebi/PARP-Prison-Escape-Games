# PARP-Prison-Escape-Games
Simple prison escape games implemented in Prolog and Haskell languages. Project created during Programming Paradigms classes on Politechnika Warszawska.

Project's purpose was to discover other programming paradigms by creating a simple game in Prolog and Haskell. We chose to create a game about escaping a prison.
